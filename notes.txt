DEV RULES
*Can alter UpdateQuality method
*Cannot alter Item class or Items property

BUSINESS LOGIC
Each good has a Quality value, which never goes negative, never goes above 50
Each good has a SellIn (days) number
Normal item quality decay rate -1
The rate of decrease doubles after SellIn days

EXCEPTIONS
"Aged Brie" quality decay rate +1
"Sulfuras" quality decay rate 0, is Legendary, quality is always 80
"Backstage passes" quality decay rate +1 with SellIn >10, +2 SellIn <=10, +3 SellIn <=5, quality goes to 0 when SellIn < 0 (or = 0?)
Conjured items decay rate -2

TODO
Add conjured items handling
