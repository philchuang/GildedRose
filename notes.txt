DEV RULES
*Can alter UpdateQuality method
*Cannot alter Item class or Items property (other than making things static)

BUSINESS LOGIC
*Quality never goes negative TESTED (normal)
*Quality never goes above 50 for normal items
*Normal item quality decay rate is -1 TESTED (normal)
*The rate of decrease doubles after SellIn days TESTED (normal)

EXCEPTIONS
"Aged Brie" quality decay rate +1 TESTED
"Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros" quality decay rate 0, is Legendary, quality is always 80/unchanged TESTED
"Backstage passes" quality decay rate +1 with SellIn >10, +2 SellIn <=10, +3 SellIn <=5, quality goes to 0 when SellIn < 0 (or = 0?)
Conjured items decay rate -2
